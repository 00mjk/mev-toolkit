## Just-in-time liquidity

<br>

* jit liquidity is a form of liquidity provision where an LP mints and burns a concentrated position immediately before and after a swap.
* because provision has significant costs, it's usually only used against very large swaps
* jit lps face competition in mev auction market - the price improvement provided by jit liquidity should be capped by twice the fee rate of the pool that jit occurs in.
