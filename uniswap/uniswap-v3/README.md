## üç£ uniswap v3

<br>

### tl; dr

* Uniswap v3 introduce the concept of "concentrated liquidity", replacing fungible ERC20 liquidity positions with non-fungible ERC-721 liquidity positions. Individual LPs get granular control over what price ranges their capital is allocated to. Individual positions are aggregated together into a single pool, forming one combined curve for users to trade against.
* it also introduced multiple fee tiers , allowing LPs to be appropriately compensated for taking on varying degrees of risk. 
* better gas refunds due to it's flashloan style architecture.
* the profitability of a liquidity provider (LP) has been called into question: estimations that about half of LPs would have been off holding assets directly rather than providing liquidity
