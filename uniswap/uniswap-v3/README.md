## üç£ uniswap v3

<br>

### tl; dr

Uniswap v3 introduced: 

* **concentrated liquidity**: replacing fungible ERC20 liquidity positions with non-fungible ERC-721 liquidity positions. 
  * individual LPs get granular control over what price ranges their capital is allocated to. 
  * individual positions are aggregated together into a single pool, forming one combined curve for users to trade against.
* **multiple fee tiers**: allowing LPs to be appropriately compensated for taking on varying degrees of risk.
