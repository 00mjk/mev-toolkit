## twamm designs

<br>

### tl; dr

* a new type of automated market maker, or AMM, that helps traders on Ethereum efficiently execute large orders.
* time weighted amm designs prevent sandwich attacks by executing transactions lazily.
* in twamm, orders are executed as if they were placed between blocks. this way, an attcker would need to straddle blocks in order to take advantage of the victim's slippage tolernace (which is riskier than simply including txs around the victim's).
