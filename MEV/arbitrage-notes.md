## Arbitrage

<br>

* Arbitrage refers to the simultaneous buying and selling of tokens in different markets 
in order to take advantage of price discrepancies of that asset.

* The simplest MEV opportunity: two DEXes offering a token at two different prices, someone can buy the token on the lower-priced DEX and sell it on the higher priced DEX in a single atomic transaction.
