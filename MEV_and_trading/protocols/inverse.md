### tl; dr


<br>

* [inverse finance](https://www.inverse.finance/) is building a suite of DeFi tools that are governed by the Inverse Finance DAO
* the first product was DCA (Dollar Cost Average) vaults, but the DAO decided to put all resources toward Anchor and their synthetic stablecoin DOLA
* anchor (later renamed to Frontier) is a lending market (mostly a fork of Compound). 
* now, fixed-rate money market (FiRM) is an improved version of frontier with additional features, increased security, and a new primitive to facilitate fixed-rate borrowing of DOLA.
