### tl; dr

<br>

* alice and bob deposit funds into a lending contract (e.g., aave, maker, compound). while bob leaves his original collateral locked in the protocol, he can withdraw ~50% or more (depending on the protocol and asset) at some algorithmic rate that gets paid to alice (for providing the funds). 
* bob can then create a short position, reinvest for a levered long position, or withdraw money (without selling the underlying and being taxed). alice, on the other hand, generates a return on her capital.
