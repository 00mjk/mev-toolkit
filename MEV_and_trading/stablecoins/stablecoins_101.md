#### fiat-collateralized stablecoins

* fiat-collateralized stablecoins are stablecoins that are backed by fiat currencies like the US dollar. 
* Their reserves are held by a central entity. The most popular fiat-backed stablecoins at this time are USDC, USDT, and BUSD. 
* The main weakness of fiat-collateralized stablecoin is centralization as the collateral of a fiat-collateralized stablecoin is held by one independent party.

#### decentralized (algorithmic) stablecoins

<br>

*  The average consumer or institutional investor would rather mint 1:1 through a centralized fiat stablecoin than have to over-collateralize by at least 150% to issue a decentralized stablecoin. 
*  For this reason, developers set out to create non-collateralized (or algorithmic) stablecoins. 
*  These coins maintain their peg without having to directly collateralize the issuance. 
*  The two largest forces in the market in this category are Terra and Fei.
