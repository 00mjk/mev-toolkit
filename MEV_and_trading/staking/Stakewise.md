### Tokenomics

<br>

* Stakewise has a dual token system that pays rewards in separate token, rETH2, mapped to ETH earned in the Beacon chain.
* The other token, sETH2. represents the ETH deposit and acts as an interest-bearinng wrapped ETH.
* Holders of sETH2 tokens earn daily rETH2 rewards.
* Stakewise has a flat fee of 10% on rewards earned by their pools.
