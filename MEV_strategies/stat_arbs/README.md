## statistical strategies (signal-based)

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>


* **statistical arbs** (non-atomic) convey informed strategies that rely on informed information (signal). examples can be arbs that rely on cross-chain or CEX + DEX strategies. 

* these strategies are more profitable and less accessible due to capital requirements and risk profile.
