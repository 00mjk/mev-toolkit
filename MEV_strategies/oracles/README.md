## oracles

<br>

### tl;dr

<br>

* price oracles are any defi tool showing an asset's price. they can either on or off chain.
* oracles should provide a trustless way of getting extrinsic (off-chain) information, and some key functions such as: collecting data from an off-chain source, transfering the data on-chain with a signed message, and making the data available by putting it in a smart contractâ€™s storage.
* oracle exploitation can generate profit opportunities (e.g., through arbitrage or liquidation, multi-block)
