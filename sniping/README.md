## Sniping techniques

### tl; dr

* Liquidity sniping happens when searchers compete to purschase an asset immediately after the creation of a liquidity pool. Tokens are then not off-loaded in the same block, but instead sold over the next minutes or hours. Profits for a sniper are not guaranteed.
