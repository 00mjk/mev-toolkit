### terminology

 
* **attestation**: at designated times, each validator is responsible for publishing different attestations that formally declare this validator's view of the chain, including the last finalized checkpoint and the current head of the chain.



* **Block builder**
The agent responsible for assembling the potential contents of a block (i.e. the set of transactions that makes up the ‚Äúpayload‚Äù of a block). In Proof of Work Ethereum it‚Äôs the miner. In Proof of Stake Ethereum it‚Äôs the validator, but this activity can separated from the validator via PBS, in which case builders need to submit bids for blocks to be included to the block proposer for inclusion.

* **Block proposer**
The agent responsible for proposing new blocks in a blockchain. In Proof of Work Ethereum it‚Äôs the miner. In Proof of Stake Ethereum it‚Äôs the validator.

* **block time**: the time interval between blocks being added to the blockchain.

* **Node Operator**
An organization/entity/person that operates validators.

* **PBS**
Proposer Builder Separation, see: State of research: increasing censorship resistance of transactions under proposer/builder separation (PBS).

* **Staker**: A user/organization/etc. which holds (w)stETH

* `feeRecipient`: field set by the block builder in the block header (coinbase address)

* payment methods on Ethereum:
   - `base_fee`: amount defined by the protocol, always paid from user -> network
   - `priority_fee`: amount defined by the user as `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, paid from user -> coinbase address
   - `block.coinbase transfer`: the EVM has an opcode which allows end user to send fund directly to the coinbase address (same recipient as `priority_fee`
    - `regular transfer`: a transaction created to send eth to other account
   

* **LMD-GHOST**: latest message drive greediest heaviest observed subtree, the fork choice rule determining which block is viewed as the current chain head.

* **Casper-FFG**: proof-of-stake consensus protocol used in conjunction with the LMD-GHOST fork choice algorithm to allow consensus clients to agree on the head of the Beacon Chain.

* **Gasper**: Ethereum‚Äôs PoS implementation, a combination of the LMD-GHOST fork choice rule, Casper FFG, and the specific reward/penalty scheme.

* **RANDAO**: random number generation scheme used to select block proposers, sort validators into committees, etc.

* **BLS**: cryptographic signature scheme used for validator attestations.

* **inactivity leak**: validators which don‚Äôt submit attestations are penalized if the chain stops finalizing.

* **slashing**: validators which maliciously propose or attest to multiple blocks at the same height have their stake reduced.

* **proposer boost**: a modification to LMD-GHOST giving additional weight to blocks proposed earlier in the slot to defend against avalanche attacks, see an explanation of a 7-block reorg in the beacon chain while this update was being rolled out.

* **distributed hash table (DHT)**: data structure containing (key, value) pairs used by Ethereum nodes to identify peers to connect to and determine which protocols to use to communicate.

* **committee**: group of at least 128 validators assigned to validate blocks in each slot. One of the validators in the committee is the aggregator.

* **slots**: a time period of 12 seconds in which a randomly chosen validator has time to proposa a block. 32 seconds = 1 epoch.

* **epoch**: represents 32 slots and takes ~6.4 minutes.

* **deposit contract**: the gateway to ethereum 2.0. It accepts any transaction with a minumum amount of 1 ETH and a valid input data.

* **input data**: also called deposit data, is a user generated, 842 long sequence of characters. it represents the validator pub key and the withdrawal pub key, which were signed with by the validator priv key. the input data needs to be added to the transaction to the deposit contract to be identified by the beacon-chain.

* **unique index**: every validator receives its unique index.

* **finality**: a transaction has "finality" when it's part of a block that can't change without a significant amount of ETH getting burned (this is managed using "checkpoint" blocks).
