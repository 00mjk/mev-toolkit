## synthetix

* [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) is one of the Ethereum's ecosystem's leading derivatives projects.
* It's a derivative liquidity protocol that powers the creation of "synths" (synthetic assets) that can be traded in a decentralized and permissionless manner.
* Synths let traders capitalize on exposure to assets without having to directly own the assets in question.
* Some of Synthetix's most popular synths are its forex synths: sUDS and sEUR.
* A foundational element of Synthetix is SNX staking, which is used for collateralizing the derivatives protocol and for creating deep liquidity for synths.
* SNX stakers earn inflationary SNX rewards and a cut of sUSD fees generated by protocols that work on top of Synthetix.
