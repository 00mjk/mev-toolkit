## Curve

<br>

* Curve, whose unique feature is the low slippage in swapping, is a decentralised exchange (DEX) for stablecoins to swap pairs like USDT - UST or USDC - BUSD. 
* CRV is the native token, whose main utility is governance. People need to lock CRV to get veCRV to vote on decisions. The most important one is voting on allocation of rewards. Monthly CRV unlocks from the release schedule and the trading fees generated on the platform are distributed to each pool's liquidity provider. Additionally, veCRV holders can vote on proposals and pool parameters.
