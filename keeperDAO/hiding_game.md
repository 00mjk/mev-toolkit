## Hiding Game

* The optimal way to trade in DeFi: a novel concept to cooperativelty hide and re-distribute MEV
* Made possible by wraping orders in a secure way that can only be executed by whitelisted Keepers, allowing KeeperDAO to provide the most optimal Limit Orders in DeFi.
* A trader can participate in the Hiding Game by submitting a trade via KeeperDAO's trading app, using the Hiding Book API, or by using a partner's integration.
* heir order will be routed through the Hiding Book and any profit captured from the resulting MEV is deposited into the treasury, which is managed by ROOK holders
* The trader who places the order also receives ROOK rewards proportional to the MEV their order created.
* The Hiding Book is an order book in which only KeeperDAO Keepers can execute.
