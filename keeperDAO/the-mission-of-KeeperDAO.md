## [The Mission of KeeperDAO](https://blog.keeperdao.com/mission/)

* Keepers are bots that work on blockchain networks like Ethereum. The are an emergent and increasingly important network participant.
* Keepers respond when there is a need to buy or sell a sequence of assets, or execute particular smart contracts in a timely manner.
* DeFi relies on Keepers. Their constant arbritage keeps prices in sync accorss dexes.
* From the keeper's perspective, a blockchain is a giant chessbord. They look for sequences of mvoes with high MEV and try to execute them.
* To be the first, they must pay block producers (minners and validators) above and beoynd the normal fee.
* Unlike block producers, Keepers were not accounted for in Ethereum's protocol design. This has turned Ethereum's public mempool (database where all unprocessed transactions are stored) into a dark forest.

### The Coordination Game

* Game-theory optimised Keeper protocol that provides a solution in the MEV incentive structure problem; aligns Keeper's incentives with those of the network participants.
* Currently it's not clear how many Keepers are there, how much liquidity they command, how protocols shoudl optimally price risk, or how users and protocols should bid for Keeper attention.
* KeeperDAO protocol fills the void by formalizing the work Keepers do in a way that benefits the nwtwork, ensuring more determinism and avoiding harmful side-effects like the exploitation of users and protocols through predatory MEV attacks.

### The Mission

* KeeperDAO is dedicated to Keepers: to bring about a decentralised economy which Keepers create more efficient, secure, and egalitarian blockchain networks.
* Research and build unique technology to coordinate access to certain shared resources - namely order and transaction pools bound for blockchain networks - allowing keepers to more efficiently capture on-chain profit - for example by executing an arbritage or liquidation.
* KeeperDAO creates new primitives that users and protocols can use to protect themselves from predatory MEV.

### Founding principles

1. Reward those that add value
2. MEV doesnt belong to block producers
3. Search for win-win scenarios
4. Solve hard problems
5. Decentralise
