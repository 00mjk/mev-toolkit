## [Proposal for Rooknomics v2.0](https://forum.keeperdao.com/t/rookonomics-v2-0/225) (nov/2021)

* Rook has been a valueless governance token, only used to incentivize the use of the protocol by rewarding users to trade.
* The tokenomics must include some value capture as a detractor of actors within DeFi who might want to fork KD.

#### Tokenomics objectives

1. Create an unforkable state for KD
2. Reward users who stake and lock for longer
3. Increase the sybil resistance of current governance model
4. Incentivize an increase in TVL through staked Rook
5. Produce a flywheel effect where an increase in staked Rook increases demand
6. Make Rook useable as collatral
7. Give users product benefits for staking Rook


### Tokenomics


1. Rook max suplly of 1.3mi
2. Adaptive emissions to market conditions
3. Governance mining
4. Staked rook utility
5. Update keeperdao revenue structure
6. Act-wide staking token usage: single-sided staking on popsicle and bancor; bond with keepers, ribbon vault, crv pool staking.
