## Liquidity Pools at KeeperDAO

<br>

* KeeperDAO offers five liquidity pools for farming ROOK tokens: ETH, WETH, USDC, renBTC, and DAI pools.
* The liquidity provided by these pools is used by KeeperDAO's Keepers for Flash Loans as well as JITU.
* When you deposit assets into a liquidity pool, you receive kToken in return which represents your share of the pool. 
* Each liquidity pool has its own kToken: kDAI for DAI pool, kETH for ETH pool, etc.
