## [Treasure Growth Plan](https://forum.keeperdao.com/t/treasury-growth-plan-phase-1/258)

* With the launch of the coordination game, treasure inflows are focused on Rook over non-native assets.
* Proposal to use existing inflows to enable self-sustaining flywheels that will allow for the constant inflow of non-native assets.


### The current state of treasure inflows

* Ninja revenue: KeeperDAO's keeper bot, Ninja, currently stands for largest source of revenue, ~ $200K per week
* CVX bribes: the revenue generated from Votium bribes is ~$250k per lockup periods
* Coordination game bids: the largest source of Rook treasure inflows.

### Ideas

* BNT for bribes: the current state of CVX bribes consists of an unoptimized distribution of votes when using Votium in an attempt to maximize the $/voce for cvx.
* Ribbon flywheel
* Tokemak flywheel
* Seed investing
