## Notes for [The New Citadel](https://keeperdao-labs.notion.site/The-New-Citadel-A-Vision-for-KeeperDAO-125ed6222f4542d99d8e171ddbe2bc38)

* executing trades on-chain sucks today (high gas, illiquidity, bad routing, expensive bridging, MEV...)
* Citadel Securities is the largest executor of trades in the world; 40% shares traded in the USA go by them.
  * they provide execution-as-a-service - when users place orders or apps like robinhood, citadel execute the trades (the amazon of trading), they take 90% profit    
* KeeperDAO allows the value of order flow itself to be harnessed, but distributing the value between users, keepers, market makers; allowing everyone participate through an API; governance through a DAO
* Products: the hiding game, the coordination game, the incentive game --> the pillars for the coordinated execution layer for DeFi


### Building a Coordination Layer for DeFi

* A coordinate execution layer lets KeeperDAO hide complexity, create economies of scale, and deliver a standard of ease and service, taking economy to the next level
* KeeperDAO as the coordinated execution layer for the entire multi-chain space

### Going Teal

* KeeperDAO propose a hybrid model, inspired by the concept of a Teal Organization: teams are self-managing and largely autonomous, organized around a well-defined function, with a simple, clear mission and clear cut goals.
* The DAO acts like a decentralized board of directors - it delegates operational decisions to teams and their contributors, and steer indirectly through the power of the purse (the ability to fund or de-fund teams).
* To help the DAO assess the performance of teams, it will be propoased and allowed to recognize high-level leadearship; each team has a lead who reports to the CEO/CTO
* Leaders may create or sponsors special KIPs which can charter and fund new teams or units. The DAO evaluates and may approve or decline these in the usual way.
* On a quarterly basis, a presentation must be made by each team or unit to the DAO about this progress.


### KeeperDAO with 80-100 contributors

### Teams

* Protocol: responsible for advancing the protocols at the heart of the network such as the Hiding Game and Coordination Game.

* Research: discover and publish new knowledge, strategies, and techniques that can benefit our network and advance the state of the art.

* Multi-chain: adapt protocols created by the protocol team to all different blockchains, so that there is a KeeperDAO presence everywhere.

* Trading: build the most efficient swap technology and advanced trading automation to ensure the best experience trading happens through the protocols.

* Lending+Borrowing: build the most efficient liquidation technology and automation to ensure that lending, borrowing, and leverage are simple and available through the protocols.

* Product: design, test, and build the web3 applications and websites that offer users the best experiences and services powered by the protocols, such as swaps, lending, and dashboards.

* Integration: make protocols simple for other parties to integrate, in particular protocols, keepers, and market makers. Provide assistance and services to those who wish to integrate.

* SRE: ensure the highest service level for products, protocols, and network so that KeeperDAO is a stable and consistent channel for exchange during all market and network conditions.

* Growth: grow the community and network KPIs through business development, outreach, research, and other programs.

* Studio: communicate products, protocols, and values through evocative, professional visual and textual communication.

* Treasury: oversee spending, monitor risk, manage investments made using the DAO treasury, prepare financial reports, and advise on tokenomics.

* Operations: Develop processes that harmonize all aspects of our organization, ranging from teams to the DAO and governance. Carry out recordkeeping that ensures transparency, coordinate tasks and planning, and determine how to be the most productive organization possible.
