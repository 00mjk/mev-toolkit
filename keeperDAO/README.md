## Core Products

<br>

### [Coordination Protocol](https://github.com/bt3gl-labs/Scratch-Space-Stateful-Blockchains-and-MEV/blob/main/keeperDAO/coordination_protocol.md)

### The Hiding Game

* Gasless limit order system that sources liquidity from all means supported by KeeperDAO Keepers.
* If a user's order creates a MEV opportunity, the user will be rewarded with a share of the MEV profits in the form of `ROOK'.

### The Hiding Vault

* A generalized liquidation-mitigation lending and borrowing NFT product. 
* The first platform supported by Hiding Vaults is Compound Finance. 
* Using a Hiding Vault mitigates both the risks and the impacts of the liquidation of users using Compound Finance. 
* If a user's position is liquidated, the user will be reimbursed with a share of the liquidation profits in the form of `ROOK`.

### Liquidity Pools

* KeeperDAO offers five single-asset LP that yield `ROOK` tokens (ETH, WETH, USDC, renBTC, and DAI): users earn `ROOK` rewards based on the number  of `ROOK` rewards allocated to the pool each quarter.
