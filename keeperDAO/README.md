## KeeperDAO notes

```
üèóÔ∏è KeeperDAO is building the Coordination Layer for DeFi.

We are creating a world where users and protocols own the value generated from their transactions, and where 
best execution and financial services are powered entirely by this value, rather than fees. Think of Citadel 
Securities, but as a public good, governed by a DAO, that returns nearly all the profit back to its users.

We have deep experience in blockchain automation, MEV, and financial systems, and want to join with others like us, 
or teach the best candidates about this exciting area of modern finance. 

DAOs are hard, so we are dedicated to creating the right environment for you to do your best work. At KeeperDAO you‚Äôll 
have the opportunity to work on solving hard and important problems that will help innovate and improve the way value 
is exchanged on the blockchain. You will be surrounded by some of the brightest minds in web3 and given all the 
resources you need to do your best work.

We‚Äôre an early stage startup with a very healthy, liquid treasury (over US$100mm), putting us in a prime position 
to grow and scale over the coming years. By joining us now you will be in a position to help meaningfully shape 
the future of open finance on the blockchain.

We‚Äôre backed by some of the most reputed investors in web3: Three Arrows Capital, Polychain Capital and Amber Group.
