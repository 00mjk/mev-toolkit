* decentralized spot and perpetual futures exchange, built on arbitrum and avalanche
* promised features: minimal liquidation risks, low costs, simple swap, capital efficiency, demand drivers
* gmx enables traders to open up to 50x leveraged long or short positions via borrowing from a multi-asset pool known as $GLP (that earns lp fees through market making, swap fees, leverage trading, and asset rebalancing).
* $GLPs function as the counterparty, as it accrues values when traders loses, and devalues when traders win. $GLP accrues 70% of all trading fees, while stakers of the protocol governance token, earn 30%. $GLP is also emerging as a form of collateral, with lending protocols integrating the LP token into their product offerings.
* native token $GMX functions as a governance, utility, and value-accrual token. all collected fees fo to the $GMX fee pool, which issues fee rewards (e.g., ETH/AVAX).
* a floor price fund helps ensure liquidity in the $GLP pool, plus a reliable stream of $ETH rewards fo $GMX stakers
* protocol's revenues come from: swap fees, trading fees, execution fees, liquidation fees, and borrow fees
* protocol risks: liquidity risks, market/oracle manipulation, centralization risk, scalability risk
