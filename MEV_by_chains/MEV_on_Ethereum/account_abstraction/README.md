## ERC-4337: account abstraction

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* "smart contract wallets": account abstraction that would avoid the need for consensus-layer protocol changes
* bundlers (new actors that are either block builders, or users that can send transactions to block builders through a bundle marketplace) package up a set of objects into a tx making a call to a special contract and sending objects to a separate mempool
