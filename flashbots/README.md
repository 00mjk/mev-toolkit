## ü§ñüî™ flashbots

<br>

### tl;dr

<br>

* **flashbots** is a research and development organization focused on mitigating the negative externalities of current MEV extraction techniques.
* after the release of MEV-geth (and later MEV-boost), much of the computation related to MEV was taken off-chain, by a side-relay that allows MEV searchers to communicate directly with nodes and other participants. This lead to a decrease in fee congestion pricing.
* however, MEV ‚Äúmarketplaces‚Äù like flashbots, are quite centralized, since the vast majority of blocks flow through it.
