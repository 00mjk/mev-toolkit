### tl;dr

<br>

* flashbots is a research and development organization focused on mitigating the negative externalities of current MEV extraction techniques and avoiding the existential risks MEV could cause to state-rich blockchains like Ethereum.

* flashbots try to move the problem to another area to prevent clogging up the Ethereum network and giving it more clarity. I works by reducing MEV's complexity by three fronts:
    - **inspect and quantize the impact of MEV**: this helps reduce the information asymmetry and people can understand the problem and its impact better (mev-Inspect).
    - **democratize the extraction of MEV**: the power to extract MEV exists in the hands of few people so they provide tools for everyone to start extracting MEV (mev-feth, mev-boost).
    - **distribute the benefit of mev**: currently, the miners and validators extract a disproportionate amount of benefits. So itâ€™s important to redistribute these to all the participants.
