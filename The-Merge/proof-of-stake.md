## Notes on proof-of-stake Ethereum

<br>


* The algorithm used in proof-of-stake Ethereum is called [LMD-GHOST]() and it works by identifying the fork that has the greatest weight of attestations in its history.
* The threat of a 51% attack still exists on proof-of-stake but it's riskier for attackers.
