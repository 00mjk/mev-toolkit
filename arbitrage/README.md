## ðŸ¥¯ arbitrage

<br>

### tl;dr

<br>


* liquidity on-chain is fragmented: thousands of pools don't communicate with each other, each providing quotes for swapping assets in real-time. This fragmentation creates an opportunity to buy low and sell high across different pools.
* for example, two DEXes offer a token at two different prices so that a token can be bought at the lower-priced DEX and sold on the higher-priced DEX in a single atomic transaction.
